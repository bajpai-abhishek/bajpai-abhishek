## About Me

I'm a digital marketer who enjoys working at the intersection of performance, creativity, and strategy.

Over the past few years, I've worked with brands across India and Australia, managing Meta Ads campaigns focused on awareness, engagement, lead generation, sales, and app installs. I've been deeply involved in the entire marketing funnel—from audience research and creative ideation to campaign optimization, reporting, and conversion rate improvement.

What sets me apart is my ability to look beyond ads. I actively collaborate on product page optimization, UI/UX improvements, and content strategy to ensure traffic converts—not just clicks. I also have experience managing influencer campaigns and community engagement, giving me a well-rounded understanding of brand growth beyond paid media.

I believe strong marketing comes from combining data, creativity, and customer understanding, and that's exactly how I approach every project.
